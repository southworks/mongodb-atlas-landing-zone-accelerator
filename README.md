# Terraform Landing Zone for MongoDB Atlas on Azure

This repository provides a modular Terraform solution for deploying a secure MongoDB Atlas environment on Azure following the recommendations in [Deploy MongoDB Atlas in Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/architecture/databases/architecture/mongodb-atlas-baseline). It features:

- Private networking and secure connectivity
- DevOps automation for remote state and identity
- End-to-end cluster setup for MongoDB Atlas
- Observability function and monitoring with Azure Application Insights and a Metrics Function App
- Automated infrastructure provisioning, Atlas cluster configuration, and a test application for validation

> [!IMPORTANT]
> The Terraform Landing Zone for MongoDB Atlas on Azure assumes that you already successfully implemented an Azure landing zone. However, you can use the Terraform Landing Zone for MongoDB Atlas on Azure if your infrastructure doesn't conform to Azure landing zones. For more information, refer to [Cloud Adoption Framework enterprise-scale landing zones](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cloud-adoption-framework/ready/enterprise-scale/)
>
> We recommend evaluating whether additional Microsoft security services beyond those listed, e.g Azure Firewall, Defender for DDoS, Defender for Cloud, Microsoft Entra, and Azure Key Vault - are appropriate for your environment. Depending on your architecture and threat model, you may also want to consider among other options:

> - [Defender for App Service](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-app-service-introduction)
> - [Defender for Servers](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/defender-for-cloud/defender-for-servers-overview)
> - [Microsoft Entra Global Secure Access (GSA)](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/entra/global-secure-access/overview-what-is-global-secure-access)

## Get Started: Deployment Steps

### 1. Review and Select Desired Architecture

Before deploying, determine the architecture that best fits your requirements and understand the modules involved:

- **Reference example architectures:**
  - **Single Region:**
    ![Single Region Architecture](docs/images/architecture-single-region.png)
  - **Multi Region:**
    ![Multi Region Architecture](docs/images/architecture-multi-region.png)
- **Learn more:**
  - Read about [available Terraform modules and their usage](./docs/wiki/Modules.md) to see which modules to compose.

### 2. Prepare Your Environment

- Review and configure [environment prerequisites](docs/wiki/Prerequisites.md).
- Configure required environment variables: [Setup Environment Guide](docs/wiki/Setup-environment.md).

### 3. Decide How to Deploy

- **Automated (Recommended):**
  - Deploy through GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows for full automation. Follow the [Pipeline Deployment Guide](docs/wiki/Deploy-with-pipeline.md).
- **Manual:**
  - Run Terraform and supporting scripts directly. See [Manual Deployment Steps](docs/wiki/Deploy-with-manual-steps.md).

### 4. Choose Your Deployment Pattern

- Both **single-region** and **multi-region** patterns are supported across automated and manual deployment options.

### 5. Clean Up Resources

To avoid unexpected charges, **always clean up resources when you're done**.

See [Cleanup.md](docs/wiki/Cleanup.md) for the full step-by-step cleanup procedure, including how to destroy Azure and MongoDB Atlas resources in the correct order.
