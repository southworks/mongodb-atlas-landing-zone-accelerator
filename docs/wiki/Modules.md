# Modules

## [Application Module](../../modules/application/readme.md)

- Deploys an App Service Plan and an Azure Web App. The Test DB Connection app has to be deployed to this Web App to test the connection with the deployed cluster. For more information, please refer the [Test DB Connection App Guide](./Test_DB_connection_steps.md).
- Provisions virtual network and subnet for the app.
- Enables VNet integration for secure connectivity validation to MongoDB Atlas.

## [DevOps Module](../../modules/devops/readme.md)

- Provisions the core resource group for state and identity management.
- Creates the Infrastructure resource group (which will be used in the step 01)
- Creates the Application resource group (which will be used in the step 02). This is optional since the step 02 is just to test the connection with the deployed cluster.
- Creates a storage account and container for Terraform remote state.
- Sets up federated identity and role assignments for automation.

## [MongoDB Atlas Configuration Module For Multi Region](../../modules/atlas_config_multi_region/readme.md)

- Configures a MongoDB Atlas project and advanced cluster for multi-region deployments.

## [Monitoring Diagnostics Module](../../modules/monitoring_diagnostics/readme.md)

- Configures Azure Monitor diagnostic settings for all infrastructure resources.
- Connects Function Apps, Storage Accounts, Key Vaults, App Service Plans, Virtual Networks, Application Insights, and Storage sub-services to the centralized Log Analytics workspace.
- Automatically discovers and enables all available log and metric categories for comprehensive observability.
- Ensures consistent diagnostic coverage across the entire solution with predictable naming conventions.

## [Observability Module](../../modules/observability/readme.md)

- Provisions observability infrastructure for monitoring MongoDB Atlas metrics in Azure. It creates all necessary resources to host a scheduled metrics collection Function App. The MongoAtlasMetrics app has to be deployed to the created Function App resource to send the metrics to the Application Insights.
